👋 Hi, I'm Tien 🎓 Graduate Student | Aspiring AI & Game Developer Based in Chicago, IL, I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern Illinois University.

With 4+ years of professional experience in E-commerce Operations (at companies like Shopee and TikTok), I bring a detail-oriented, analytical mindset to the world of software development. I’m passionate about merging technical logic with creative storytelling—specifically within game design and AI.

Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Algorithms, Discrete Math

Tools: Git/GitHub, jGrasp

🌟 My Focus & Goals Current Mission: Mastering Java and deep-diving into Graph Theory and Algorithms.

Dream Goal: Working in AI for Game Development. As a lifelong fan of The Sims, I want to use technology to bring more diverse cultural representation (especially Vietnamese culture!) into the gaming world.

Seeking: 2026 Summer Internships in Software Engineering or Game Dev.

📊 Professional Evolution Now: Graduate Admissions Assistant @ NEIU | MSCS Candidate
